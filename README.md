# PasswordGenerator

For this project, I have created a basic Password Generator using Javascript. 
The deployed project is capabale of:
    -Receiving an input from the user for the length of password and will only accept lengths between 8 and 128
    -If an appropriate length is not selected, the user will not be able to proceed.
    -Receiving user input to determine which character-types the user would like to input and then only including the selected character-types in the generated password
    -If no character-type is selected, the user will not be able to proceed
    -The program will generate a randomised password which is of the appropriate length and only includes the selected character-types.

I would like to thank Strahinja Ajvaz and Lu-Vuong Le for their continued guidance and assistance
